READ BEFORE YOU RUN THIS!

You can exit this in 2 ways:
1. ( easy ):
   restart PC
   
2. ( harder ):
   1. open task manager by CTRL+SHIFT+ESC
   2. try to find process named KernelLoad
   2.5 if you cant navigate with arrows try ALT+TAB to switch do Task Manager
   3. End KernelLoad
   
Good to prank people, cause it doesn't need administrator privillages
